# dlnd-face-generation
Introduction
  Used Depp Convolutional generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

Description
  In this project, I've defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

  At the end of the notebook, I visualize the results of trained Generator to see how it performs; The generated samples look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
